## Introduction
Every year, countless new tools, libraries, frameworks, ingredients, etc. are released in order to help us create our next project.

With our project we aim to **collect and organize** the best resources, by providing simple guides and explanations given by our communities and checked by experts.

Best of all, we intend to use the tools that **GitHub** provides (such as discussions, hosting, issues and pull requests) in order to manage the project.
