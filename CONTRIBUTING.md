title: Contribution Guidelines
subtitle: Refer to these rules before contributing to a project
---

But first, a disclaimer:

> Depending on the website (or rather: *the toolbox*) that you want to contribute to, rules may vary. Be sure to check the specific guidelines for your situation.

Here are the more generic ones (these can be invalid for some sites).

- Submit an issue, following the given template (if there is one), detailing the resource you want to add.
- Fork the repository, make the changes, and submit a pull request.
- Tag everything according to the guidelines.
- Follow the same directory structure as the one described by the website or by looking at how other pages are organized.
- Always add tags and categories where necessary. Don't just throw a resource out there without putting it in the right place.
- Make the page presentable: divide sections, highlight code and **be clear**.

{% include notification.html message="**Remember:** If a resource already exists, try to expand on the information given instead of creating a new page for it." %}
