response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,

not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.</p>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.</p>

reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at

reporter of any incident.</p>
